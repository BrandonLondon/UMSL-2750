**CS2750 System programming and Tools Fall 2019**

**Project #1 [30 points]**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due date is Thursday, September 12th. You should submit your files through canvas.

**Attention!** In the beginning of each program (Bash script file), after &quot;shebang&quot; line, there should be comments with the author&#39;s name and the purpose of a script. Up to 3 points will be subtracted from your score for each part of the project if you don&#39;t include this information.

1. [30 points] Write a Bash shell script named **info.sh**. The command for execution should take in 2 arguments, though for now it does not have to include any validation of these arguments:

- The name of your script;
- &quot;Usage&quot; message (what should be typed to execute your file);
- Current date and time;
- The name of the runner of the script;
- The name of current working directory;
- The name of UNIX machine;
- The name of login shell;
- Contents of the file specified as the first argument;
- Number of text lines in the first argument;
- A listing of the second argument (assuming it is a directory);
- Total number of parameters of the script;
- Calendar for October of the current year;
- Disk usage;
- Current number of users in the system;
- Current time.

**Important:**

1) make sure that in the beginning of your script you include information about a shell that will execute your script and the &#39;usage&#39; line;

2) each portion of the output must be preceded with some clarifying information;

4) use manual pages to study commands that you will need in your script and that were not discussed in the class (possibly, **du** , **cut** , **date** with specific options).

Make sure and submit through canvas.
