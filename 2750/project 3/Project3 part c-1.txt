[20 points] For this part, include a text document with the regular expressions for some sed calls that would do the following tasks:
1) Remove any uppercase or lowercase version of my initials (MWH) from a document and replace them with MRH.
Answer: sed 's/\bMWH\b/MRH/gI' your_file
2) Write a regular expression that would match any file ending in .jpg
Answer:  ls -l | sed -n '/\.jpg$/p'
2a) Using the above regular expression, use sed to replace that extension with the extension .jpeg
Answer:  ls -l | sed -n 's/jpg$/jpeg/$/g'
3) Give a sed command that would output every line in a file that did not start with the letter ‘a’ and does not end with .html
Answer:sed -n '/^a.*\.html$/!p' testfile.txt
4) Write a line in sed to find all sequences of 10 digits in a row (a raw phone number) and replaces it with a more nicely formatted one. For example, it would replace 1234567890 with (123)456-7890
Answer: sed -r 's/\b([0-9]{3})([0-9]{3})([0-9]{4})\b/\(\1)\2-\3/' testfile.txt
